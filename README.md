# 1D-Burgers-Equation-ROMs

Repository for reduced order models of the 1D Burgers' equation, based on a Finite Element Method implementation. Includes variations like POD, quadratic manifold, local-POD, POD-ANN, dense autoencoders, and convolutional autoencoders. Focuses on studying the handling of moving discontinuities.
